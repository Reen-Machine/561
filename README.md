# 561
Ryan Benvenuti and Victoria Ryan's CSC 561 final project
We programmed using the Unity Cluster, we couldn't figure out how to connect it to github, but we could access eachothers files there so we worked on it together there.

Final.ipynb is the program we wrote, we used transfer learning for this project, using the homework assignment 3 as a jumping off point
Train_labels.csv contains the labels for all the images
We could not upload the images here, so here's a link to the Google drive with them all: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y3TItJ5vKeLKpXG1vIF-7LxP79IiPVjZ/view?usp=sharing
